## About Me
> How do I host my own?
- [ ] github pages README.

I was born and raised in Hoboken, NJ before moving to LA three years ago. I studied Strategic Communications and Marketing with a focus on relationship management/development. I work for the Operations Team at Bird as an Engagement Manager. Outside of work I love to spend time at the beach, hike, snowboard, rollerblade and hangout with friends. I also frequent concerts, hockey games and comedy shows. 
        
> Optional Section: You may want to fill out this as a section to help introduce yourself to new joiners or to people from outside your team. Feel free to keep it light and don't worry about going into much detail about yourself in a professional sense, as that can be covered by later sections. Some suggested points might be where you grew up, what your hobbies are or a fun fact about yourself.

## How to Contact Me

    - I generally prefer Slack if it's something we can easily communicate about and zoom if it's necessary to go into more detail.
    - Anytime there are open slots on my calendar, it's free game to schedule something with me.

> Essential Section: You might want to think about some caveats here. Perhaps Slack is fine for a quick question but for longer communication you'd prefer to speak in person.

## Preferred Working Style

Typically I prefer to work in collaborative environments, with goals of creating unique foward thinking processes. I take breaks periodically throughout the day and tend to expereience waves of energy and efficiency. I like to be looped in on changes being made, challeneges that arise and have and maintain an open line of communication.   
- I'm a lover of feedback and will always take constructive criticism into account, I hope that my counterparts feel the same.

> Recommended Section: This section is pretty open to interpretation. You might want to think about practical details like what time of day you focus best, or whether you have external commitments at specific times. Equally you can include more abstract details like whether you find certain kinds of collaboration helpful to get your work done (pairing or shadowing work for example).

## What Motivates Me

    - I'm motivated by contstanly having the opportunity to implement new processes and seeing them succeed or fail. 
    - I am passionate about creating genuine relationships with the people I work with.
    - I enjoy building mutually beneficial partnerships with strong communication and transparency.
    
> Recommended Section: Think about what gives you energy in work. What, about the work that you do, motivates you to push yourself? This doesn't need to be inspirational, it can be as simple as you enjoying seeing the results. The purpose of this section is to help your line manager and squad members to gain a picture of the work each person finds meaningful and interesting.

## What Demotivates Me

    - I tend to become demotivated when goals are not aligned amongst my team and different departments. 
    - When a process isn't working, I'm someone who likes to see a pivot happen wuickly and efficiently.
> Recommended Section: The flip side of the above. Everyone has parts of their work they find less interesting, and they won't be the same for everyone. You never know, a task you find impossibly tedious might be something someone else really enjoys - if so, you've discovered a win-win!

## My Blind Spots

    - There are times where I try to be too independent and don't ask questions as often as I should
        - I need to improve my organizational skills and habits
        - I should ask for feedback on a more consistent basis

Recommended Section: Everyone needs help sometimes. This is a good section to list the things you know you need help with or actively want feedback on. One caveat is that listing something here doesn't automatically excuse it! If you know you need to work on a particular area then please make sure you are doing so, soliciting feedback to measure your progress.

> Optional Section: It might be tempting to use this section to vent, that's absolutely fine but the more constructive the better. If there are simple things people can reasonably avoid doing, then list them here. Bear in mind that you will also need to also read your squad members' pet peeves section, it's a 2 way street.
